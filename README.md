# OTB Test

A webpage displaying three hotel booking products, with sort and expandable detail functionality.

## Install & preview

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Preview with `npm run preview`

Run the test suite with `npx vitest --reporter=verbose` ðŸ’¥

## Details

As I would do any new project, I've gone for a **functionality first** approach.

### Testing & markup

- TDD - Write a test and watch it fail, build a component to pass the test. Refactor and repeat.
- Semantic HTML - using React Testing Library I am encouraged to write accessible HTML markup, rather than a concoction of `div`â€™s

I get close to completing the acceptance criteria with only markup.

### Styling & CSS

Using Tailwind CSS enabled quick styling, however I could have used a more robust solution like CSS modules or CSS-in-JS. The tests provided confidence that any breaking changes will be noticed.

### Acceptance criteria

- âœ… Sort the results by price (this should be the default)
- âœ… Sort the results by star rating and highlight when active
- âœ… Sort the results alphabetically by hotel name and highlight when active
- âœ… Ability to toggle expanded hotel description
